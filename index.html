        <b>What is software?</b>
        
        In earlier times, software was simple in nature and hence, software development was a simple activity. However, as technology improved, software became more complex and software projects grew larger. Software development now necessitated the presence of a team, which could prepare detailed plans and designs, carry out testing, develop intuitive user interfaces, and integrate all these activities into a system. This new approach led to the emergence of a discipline known as software engineering.
